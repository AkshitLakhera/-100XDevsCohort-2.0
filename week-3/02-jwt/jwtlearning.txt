JWT (JSON Web Tokens):

    What it is: A compact and secure way to transmit information between parties as a JSON object. Commonly used for authentication and authorization.
    How it works:
        Encode: Payload (data) is encoded with a secret key (signing).
        Send: The encoded token is sent in HTTP headers or URL parameters.
        Verify: Server verifies the token using the same secret key.
        Decode: If valid, payload is decoded and trusted.

Zod:

    What it is: A TypeScript-first schema validation library for data validation.
    How it works:
        Define schema: Create a schema using Zod's intuitive syntax to specify data types and constraints.
        Validate data: Use Zod to check if input data matches the schema, catching errors early.
        Error handling: Zod provides detailed error messages for invalid data.
